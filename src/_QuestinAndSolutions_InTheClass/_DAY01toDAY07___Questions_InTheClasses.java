===day02================>
1)  Create a Short Wrapper Class variable
	a)print the max and min values of short data type on the console
	b)use any method and try to understand the logic of the method
	 	 
	 
2)  Type a program which calculates the cube of a number
	which is entered by user.  a==> Cube: a*a*a
		
	
3)  Type a program which calculates the area and perimeter of a square
	whose side length is entered by user.
		 a==> Area:a*a
		 a==> Perimeter:4*a
			 
		 
4)  Type a program which calculates the area and the perimeter of 
	a rectangle whose length and width are entered by user.
		hint 1: Area of a rectangle is width x length
		hint 2: Perimeter of a rectangle is 2 x (width + length)
		
				
5)	Type a program which calculates the volume of a rectangular prism
	whole length, width, and height are entered by user.
	 	hint 1: volume of a rectangular prism is width x lenght x height
		 		 
		 
6)  Type a program which converts the mile to kilometer.
	mile value will be entered by user. (use double)
	 	hint 1: km = mile * 1.6

===day03===================>
8)  Swap the value of two integer:
	a=12;  b=5;  ==>  a=5; b=12; 
		 	

9) Get a number from user and print last digit of that number on the console
		
			
10) Get a 3-digit integer from user and return the sum of its digit


===day04=========================>
11) Get a number from user then tell IF the number is even or odd


12) Get a number from user , then check if the number is negative of positive


13) (Just use "IF" statement) 
    Get the length and the height of a rectangle from user, if they equal to 
    each other print "Square" on the console, otherwise print "Rectangle" on the console.
	    
			
14) (Use "IF Else" statement) 
     Get the length and the height of a rectangle from user, if they equal to each other
     print "Square" on the console, otherwise print "Rectangle" on the console.
				
		
15) Get the day name from user, then tell to the user if it is week day or weekend day	


===day05==============================>			
16) 	Ask user to enter year type java code by using if -  else if() statement.
		write a program to check if a year is leap year or not.
		if the year is divisible by 100 then it must be divisible by 400.
		if a year is not divisible by 100 then it must be divisible 4.
	
	
17)		 Ask user to enter a 4 digit integer, then print the sum of the first
		 and the last digits of the number on the console.
		 For example: if user enters 1234 you will and 1 and 4, then print on the console 5
		 
		
18) 	 Get a number from user, 
		 if the number is less than zero, print "Negative"
		 if the number is greater than zero, print "Positive"
		 if the number equals to zero, print "Neutr"
		
		
19) 	Get the day name from user, the tell to the user if it is week day or weekend day

			
20) 	A school has following rules for grading system:
		1. Below 50 - D   
		2. 50 to 59 - C     
		3. 60 to 79 - B.   
		4. From 80 to 100 - A
		Ask user to enter marks and print the corresponding grade.
		
		
21) 	 Ask user to enter his/her age and gender (M-->male, F-->female)
		 if the age is negative, and gender is different from M and F give error message
		 if the age is greater then 65 and gender is male print "retired" otherwise "need to work"
		 if the age is greater than 60 and gender is female print "retired' otherwise "need to work"
		  
		
22)		 Ask user to enter an integer.
		 If the integer is less than zero check if it less than -9. If it is less than -9 print "too small" otherwise print "small".
		 If the integer is greater than zero check if it is greater than 9. If it is greater than 9 print "too big" otherwise print "big".
		 
				 
===day06========================>		 
23) 	Ask user to enter a year
		Type java code by using nested if() statement.
		Write a program to check if a year is leap year or not.
		if the year is divisible by 100 then it must be divisible by 400.
		If a year is not divisible by 100 then it must be divisible by 4.
		

24) 	Type java code by using nested if() statement.
		Ask user to enter a password..
			
		If the initial of the password is uppercase then check if it is ‘A’ or not. 
		If it is ‘A’ the output will be “Valid Password” 
		otherwise the output will be “Invalid Password”
		For example;     Ali ==> Valid password    -     ali ==> Invalid    -    Mark ==> Invalid
			
		If the initial of the password is lowercase then check if it is ‘z’ or not. 
		If it is ‘z’ the output will be “Valid Password” 
		otherwise the output will be “Invalid Password”
		For example;     zoe ==> Valid password    -     Zoe ==> Invalid    -    john ==> Invalid
		

25)  	Type java code by using switch() statement.
		Type a code to get the number of month whose name is entered by user
		
				
26) 	Type java code by using ternary and if-else. 
		Ask user to enter two integers
	    Write a program to print the minimum one on the console.
		

27)		Ask user to enter a String. 
		If the String has 2 characters, output will be “It is valid for state abbreviations” 
		Otherwise, output will be “It is not valid for state abbreviations”
		
	
28) 	Ask user to enter an integer. 
		If the number has 3 digits, output will be “This number has 3 digits.” 
		Otherwise, output will be “This number has no 3 digits.”
		

29)		Ask user to enter a number. 
		If the number is less than 10 and greater than or equal to 0, calculate its cube. 
		Otherwise, calculate its square.
			Cube of a = a*a*a        Square of a = a*a 
		
		
30)		Type java code by using nested ternary.
		Write a program to check if a year is leap year or not.
		If the year is divisible by 100 then it must be divisible by 400.
		If a year is not divisible by 100 then it must be divisible by 4.	
		
		
31) 	Type java code by using nested ternary.
		Ask user to enter his/her age and gender(M ==> Male, F==>Female)
	    If the age is greater than 65 and gender is male print "Retired" otherwise "Need to work"
		If the age is greater than 60 and gender is female print "Retired" otherwise "Need to work"
