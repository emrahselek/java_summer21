21) 	Type java code by using while loop,
        Write a program that prompts the user to input a number.
        It should then print the multiplication table of that number.

        3x1=3  3x2=6  3x3=9  3x4=12 3x5=15  3x6=18  3x7=21  3x8=24  3x9=27  3x10=30


22)   		 Type java code by using while loop,
	         Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer.
	         It should then find sum of the digits of that number.
	         	123 ==> 1+2+3 = 6


23) 	Type java code by using while loop,
        Write a program to count the factors of an integer which is entered by user.
        Factors of 12 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
        Factors of 8  = 1, 2, 4, 8
        Factors of 15 = 1, 3, 5, 15


24)		  Ask user to enter an integer.
		  If the integer is less than 100, tell user "Won!"
		  Otherwise tell user "Lost!"



==day13==============>
25) 	For the String "1234_?!abcdef", type a code to count the number of letters, 
    	the number of digits and the number of others by using do-while loop.



26) 		 Ask user to enter an integer
             If the integer is even print on the console "You won!"
             Otherwise ask user to enter another integer


27)			 Ask user to enter his/her first name
             If the initial is lower case print a message like "Make the initial upper case"
             If the initial is upper case print a message like "You did it right"


28)			 Ask user to enter password.
			 If the password has more than 6 characters print "Password is valid..."
			 Otherwise, print "Make the password longer than 6 characters" and ask user to enter a new password



29) 		 Ask user to enter an integer. 
             If the integer is divisible by 5, tell user to "Won"
             Otherwise tell user "Lost" and ask user if she/he wants to play again.
             if yes ask a new number to enter, if no say Thanks.


30) 		Ask user to enter an integer and print them until 10 .
