 Static work flow in a single class:
 When u run a class in java, following steps will be executed.
 1) Identification of static members from top to bottom 
 	(During this process JVM assigns default value for each variable 
  	 at the time of declaration)
 2) Execution of static variable assignments and static blocks from 
 	top to bottom
 3) Execution of main 
 
 
 //-----------------------------Static Control Flow in multiple classes---------------------------\\
    
    1) Identification of static members from from parent to child and off course from top to bottom
       During this process JVM assigns default value for each variable at the time of declaration)
    2) Execution of static variable assignments and static blocks from parent to child and off course from top to bottom
    
    3) Execution of main method of the child. if child class does not have one main method then parent's main method will be executed. 
****Important Note: Now, if u run the parent class only parent will be executed child class will not be loaded nor will be executed. because parent class members by default available to the child class where as child class members by default are not available to the parent class



//----------------------------Instance Control Flow in a single class---------------------------\\
 0) static control flow will be executed(if there is object creation then go to next if NOT then u stop)
 1) Identification of instance members from top to bottom
  (During this process JVM assigns default value for each variable at the time of declaration)
 2) Execution of instance variable assignments and instance blocks from top to bottom
 3) Execution of constructor.
 //----------------------------Instance Control Flow in multiple classes-------------------------\\
 * Whenever u create a child object following will occur;
 0) static control flow will be executed from parent to child (if there is object creation(IN CHILD CLASS) then go to next if NOT then u stop)
 
 1) Identification of instance members from parent to child and off course top to bottom (During this process JVM assigns default value for each variable at the time of declaration)
  
  PARENT ONLY;
 2) Execution of instance variable assignments and instance blocks from top to bottom in PARENT CLASS
 3) Execution of constructor in PARENT CLASS.
 
    CHILD ONLY;
 4) Execution of instance variable assignments and instance blocks from top to bottom in CHILD CLASS
 5) Execution of constructor in CHILD CLASS.
 ****Important Note: Now, if u run the parent class only parent will be executed child class will not be loaded nor will be executed. because parent class members by default available to the child class where as child class members by default are not available to the parent class
